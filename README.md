# Device Location Tracker

## Project Overview
Device Location Tracker is a web application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io that allows users to track the location of devices in real-time by generating unique links. Users can share these links with devices that send their location data to a central server, which then forwards the location updates to the corresponding laptop or client.

## Installation
To set up the Device Location Tracker locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/device-location-tracker.git
   cd device-location-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com/) installed. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   Start the application using the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Click on the button to generate a unique link.
3. Share the generated link with a device that will send location updates.
4. When the device sends its location data via the link, updates will be received on the client side.

## Features
- Generate unique links for tracking devices using UUIDs.
- Real-time location updates via WebSockets.
- Simple and user-friendly interface for easy access and use.
- Supports multiple devices connecting simultaneously.
